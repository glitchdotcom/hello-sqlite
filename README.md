# hello-sqlite

A starter with has a database

- this app uses sqlite but you can power your apps with [a number of other storage options](https://glitch.com/storage)
- `sqlite.db` is created and put into the `.data` folder, a hidden directory whose contents aren’t copied when a project is remixed. you can see the contents of `.data` in the console under "Logs"
- to save to the database, remix this app!

On the front-end,

- edit `views/index.html`,  `public/style.css`, and `public/client.js`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,

- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy.
